# Data Extraction to Excel using Python

This guide walks you through the steps to extract data from a webpage and save it to an Excel file using Python. We'll use Selenium for web scraping and `pandas` for data manipulation and saving to Excel.

## Prerequisites

- Python installed on your machine.
- `pandas`, `selenium`, and other required libraries installed.
- Basic understanding of Python and web scraping.

## Step 1: Download ChromeDriver

1. Go to the [ChromeDriver download page](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).
2. Download the version of ChromeDriver that matches the version of Chrome you are using.
3. Extract the downloaded file to a known directory on your computer.

## Step 2: Set Up Your Python Script

Open your Python editor and prepare your script with the necessary imports:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
import pandas as pd
